                                    Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
                                    conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
                                    original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
                                    and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
                                    following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
                                    exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
                                    intended for use by those authorized to give the public
                                    permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
                                    copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
                                    irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
                                    and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
                                    Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
                                    applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
                                    material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
                                    material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
                                    licensed material, or material used under an exception or
                                    limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

                                    Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
                                    licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
                                    licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
                                    the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
                                    example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
                                    copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
                                    licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
                                    other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
                                    the licensed material may still be restricted for other
                                    reasons, including because others have copyright or other
                                    rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
                                    such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
                                    Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
                                    respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations

                                    Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                                    License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                                    its terms and conditions.

                                    4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                                    Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in

                                    and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                                    Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                                    authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                                    necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                                    technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                                    Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                                    simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                                    (4) never produces Adapted Material.
                                    <br/><br/>

                                    Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                                    Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                                    Material.

                                    are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                                    with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,

                                    the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                                    assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                                    extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                                    Rights, but not otherwise.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this

                                    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                                    collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                                    Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society

                                    licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                                    reserves any right to collect such royalties.

                                    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right

                                    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not

                                    Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

                                    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
                                    right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
                                    of this Public License.

                                    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the

                                    distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
                                    will not terminate this Public License.

                                    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
                                    terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
                                    <br/><br/>

                                    Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
                                    independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Section 8 -- Interpretation.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
                                    shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
                                    conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
                                    be made without permission under this Public License.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
                                    deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
                                    minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
                                    cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
                                    without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
                                    conditions.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
                                    failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
                                    Licensor.
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
                                    as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
                                    that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
                                    processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
                                    <br/><br/>
